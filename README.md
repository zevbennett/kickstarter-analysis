# Kickstarter Analysis For Play Production
Performing an analysis on kickstarter data to recognize trends in the success (or failure) of play funding kickstarter projects.

There are two primary factors which should be considered with respect to a kickstarter campaign regardless of where it is. 

These are: 

1. Funding Goal
2. Timing of kickstarter campaign


### Part A: The US

I found that most successful campaigns kept their goal under $4000 and launched the campaign mid-June. Refer to the Excel shee for the specific data. 

### Part B: The UK

Similarly, the successes in the UK kept their goals low and launched sometime in early summer.
